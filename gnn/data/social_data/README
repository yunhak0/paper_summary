## Detail

Below are some of the data sets we have used for experiments in [2] and [3]. All are in matlab format.  Each data set has two variables: network and groups. "network" is a symmetric sparse matrix representing the interaction between users, and "groups" are the groups subscribed by users. We use that as the class labels in our work.
